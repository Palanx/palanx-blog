1. Heat a pot over medium heat. Add the [Sauté](#sauté) ingredients and cook until the shallot/green onion is golden.  
2. Add the [Spices](#spices) ingredients and stir. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the peanut butter is lightly toasted.  
3. Add the [To Boil](#to-boil) ingredients and stir. Once it reaches a gentle boil, cook for 10-15 minutes, until the potato is tender.  
4. Turn off the heat. Add the [Seasonings](#seasonings) and stir. Serve with white rice or stir-fried vegetables.  
5. Garnish with fresh cilantro; it also adds a bit of flavor.  

# Notes / Tips
- Use less chicken broth for a thicker consistency.  
- In the photo I placed the rice underneath the Massaman Curry, but it’s usually served on the side.
