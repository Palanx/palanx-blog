# Ingredients
{{< keyword icon="user" >}} 2 servings {{< /keyword >}}
* **2** tuna steaks
* **1** garlic clove
* **1** lemon
* **1/3 cup** light soy sauce
* **1 tbsp** sesame oil
* **1 tbsp** black or white sesame seeds (can be mixed)
* Ground pepper

# Step by step
{{< keyword icon="clock" >}} 6 min {{< /keyword >}}
1. Finely chop the garlic clove.
2. Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl and mix.
3. Pat dry the tuna steaks with paper towels. Press each side against the paper until as dry as possible.
4. Add pepper to both sides of the tuna steaks and press gently so the pepper adheres to the flesh.
5. Pour 1/4 of the mixture into each of two plates. Place one tuna steak on each plate, turning to coat all surfaces with the mixture and sesame seeds. Some people also dip the edges of the tuna into dry sesame seeds so that more seeds stick to the sides.
6. Place both plates in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.
7. Heat a pan over high heat. When hot, add a little oil, place a tuna steak in the pan, ensuring the side that was face-down while marinating is in contact with the pan surface. Cook for 2 minutes.
8. Flip the steak, pour another 1/4 of the mixture on top, and cook for 1 more minute.
9. One steak is ready. For the next one, clean the pan and repeat the process.
