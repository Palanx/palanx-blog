{{< lead >}}
An exploration of the connection between stress, emotional repression, and physical illness, with a compassionate approach to mind–body health.
{{< /lead >}}

### Topic
Stress, emotional repression, and physical illness.

### Approach
Psychosomatic medicine; links unexpressed emotions with health deterioration, encouraging the recognition and healthy expression of boundaries.

### Why Read It
* Shows how saying “yes” when you feel “no” impacts health.
* Presents real clinical cases connecting mind and body.
* Offers strategies to recognize physical signs as early warnings.

### Common Objections
- **“There isn’t always a causal relationship”**: presented as a framework for exploration, not an absolute diagnosis.
- **“It’s too psychological”**: seeks to balance medical perspective with emotional insight.

### For Whom
Anyone who suspects their physical health is affected by how they handle emotions and boundaries.

### Not For
Those seeking purely biomedical explanations without considering emotional context.

### Key Ideas
- Saying “yes” when you feel “no” erodes well-being.
- Constant self-denial creates chronic stress and weakens the immune system.
- Listening to and respecting bodily signals is preventive care.

### How to Apply
- Before committing to something, observe your breathing and body tension.
- Practice a kind but firm “no” in safe situations.
- Record physical symptoms alongside significant emotional events.

### Complementary Books
- *El mito de la normalidad* — for cultural and social context.
- *On Self-Hatred* — to work on self-criticism and emotional exhaustion.
