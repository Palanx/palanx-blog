{{< lead >}}
A guide to freeing yourself from suffering by questioning the beliefs that create it, using the personal inquiry method called *The Work*.
{{< /lead >}}

### Topic
Cognitive restructuring and radical acceptance.

### Approach
Philosophy of acceptance with Stoic and Buddhist influences; proposes a systematic questioning of stressful thoughts to transform our relationship with reality.

### Why Read It
* Teaches a practical, repeatable method for questioning beliefs.
* Helps reduce anxiety, anger, and sadness caused by automatic thoughts.
* Encourages living in greater harmony with what we cannot change.

### Common Objections
- **“It’s resignation”**: it’s not passivity, but freedom from useless resistance.
- **“It’s too simple”**: its simplicity is its strength, but it requires practice.

### For Whom
People who want to reduce mental suffering and live with greater inner peace.

### Not For
Those seeking a traditional clinical approach or strictly experimental evidence.

### Key Ideas
- We don’t suffer from events, but from the stories we tell ourselves about them.
- *The Work* consists of 4 questions and a thought reversal exercise.
- Questioning a thought reduces its power over us.

### How to Apply
- Write down a thought that causes you suffering.
- Ask yourself:  
  1. Is it true?  
  2. Can you absolutely know that it’s true?  
  3. How do you react when you believe that thought?  
  4. Who would you be without that thought?  
- Reverse the thought and find examples of how this new version could be as true or truer.
