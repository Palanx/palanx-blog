{{< lead >}}
An ironic and insightful look at how we complicate our lives with rigid and destructive interpretations.
{{< /lead >}}

### Topic
Psychology of self-sabotage.

### Approach
Constructivism and brief therapy; satire as a tool to expose destructive thinking patterns.

### Why Read It
* Uses humor to **lower defenses** and help us see ourselves in the described situations.
* Serves as a mirror to recognize cognitive distortions and mental rigidity.
* Easy to read and remember.

### Common Objections
- **“It’s too ironic”**: the sharp humor is intentional to break excessive seriousness.
- **“It doesn’t give solutions”**: it’s a book of awareness, not a protocol.

### For Whom
Anyone who wants to identify how their mind creates unnecessary problems and have a laugh in the process.

### Not For
Those looking for a step-by-step manual on *“how to be happy”*.

---

### Key Ideas
- The interpretation we give to events creates more suffering than the events themselves.
- Clinging to personal **“absolute truths”** is a sure recipe for bitterness.
- Life gets more complicated by insisting on being right than by the original problem.

### How to Apply
- Detect phrases like *“this is always the case”* and change them to *“sometimes it happens that…”*.
- **Ask yourself:** *“Do I want to be right or do I want to be at peace?”*.
- Make a list of rigid expectations and decide which to let go.
