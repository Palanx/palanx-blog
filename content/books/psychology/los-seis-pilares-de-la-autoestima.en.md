{{< lead >}}
Six practical habits to build and maintain solid and realistic self-esteem.
{{< /lead >}}

### Topic
Self-esteem development through conscious habits.

### Approach
Humanism and personal responsibility — self-esteem is built by living consistently with principles, not as something “innate.”

### Why Read It
- Breaks down self-esteem into **6 trainable habits**.
- Includes **daily exercises** to internalize change.
- Promotes **self-responsibility** and **realistic self-acceptance**.

### Common Objections
- **“It’s too demanding”**: they are guides, not dogmas; adapt at your own pace.
- **“It’s not for severe trauma”**: combine with therapy to avoid excessive self-criticism.

### For Whom
Those looking for a structured method to gain self-confidence and self-assertion without falling into arrogance.

### Not For
Those wanting only quick motivation; it requires sustained practice.

### Key Ideas
- Self-esteem ≠ feeling good all the time, but **confidence in your own mind** and the **right to be happy**.
- The six pillars:
  1. **Living Consciously**
  2. **Self-Acceptance**
  3. **Self-Responsibility**
  4. **Self-Assertiveness**
  5. **Living Purposefully**
  6. **Personal Integrity**
- Daily practice is more valuable than isolated **“revelations.”**

### How to Apply
- **Morning:** write down 3 actions aligned with your values.
- **Evening:** reflect in 3–5 sentences on whether you acted according to them.
- **Integrity Scan:** detect if any action contradicted your values.
