Here I share reflections and learnings on personal development. These are not infallible manuals or magic formulas, but ideas, experiences, and readings that have helped me bring order to my life and better understand who I am.

Personal development is not a destination; it’s an ongoing process. Sometimes it starts with a simple question like *“Why do I do what I do?”*, and other times it comes from hard blows that force us to rethink everything.  

In this section you’ll find reflections and articles of this kind. I’m not here to offer absolute answers, but to share what has worked for me. If any of these ideas resonate with you, welcome; if not, at least you’ll leave with another perspective—or perhaps simply a new question to explore.
