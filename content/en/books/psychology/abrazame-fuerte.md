{{< /lead >}}

### Topic
Couples therapy based on attachment.

### Approach
Attachment perspective with the view of love as a basic need and central axis for emotional well-being.

### Why Read It
* Translates attachment theory into practical exercises and conversations.
* Helps break cycles of disconnection and recurring conflict.
* Provides a common language to strengthen emotional communication.

### Common Objections
- **“It idealizes love”**: the model can be adapted for those who see love as a means, not necessarily an absolute end.
- **“It’s very focused on traditional couples”**: the principles apply to all types of relationships.

### For Whom
Couples who want to reinforce their emotional connection or resolve persistent conflicts.

### Not For
Relationships with abuse or active violence, where prior professional intervention is needed.

### Key Ideas
