# Ingredients
{{< keyword icon="user" >}} 5–6 servings {{< /keyword >}}
* **400 g** risotto rice
* **400 g** shiitake mushrooms (can be less)
* **1** small onion, diced
* **120 g** unsalted butter
* **100 g** grated parmesan cheese
* **1 cup** white wine
* **1.5 liters** [Shiitake Broth](/cook/brodo-shiitake) or chicken stock
* **1** bay leaf
* Olive oil

# Step by step
{{< keyword icon="clock" >}} 30 min {{< /keyword >}}
1. Heat a wok over high heat and melt **20 g** of unsalted butter with **1** bay leaf. Once the butter is melted, remove the leaf.
2. Add the **400 g** of shiitake mushrooms, stir until golden, then set aside.
3. Heat a pot over high heat and melt **50 g** of unsalted butter. Once melted, add the diced onion and stir until golden.
4. Add the **400 g** of rice (unwashed) and stir for 2–3 minutes so the butter coats the grains. Throughout the recipe, never stop stirring the rice.
5. Add **1 cup** of white wine and stir until it evaporates.
6. Begin incorporating the hot shiitake broth, **two ladles at a time**. Without stopping stirring, add more broth as it evaporates and absorbs into the grains. You can check if it’s evaporated by running a spatula along the bottom of the pot — you should see the bottom clearly.
7. Once all the broth is absorbed or when the rice is al dente, turn off the heat and add the cooked shiitakes, **50 g** of unsalted butter, and the **100 g** of parmesan cheese. Stir until everything is melted and fully incorporated.
8. Serve immediately. Optionally, drizzle a small amount of olive oil on top after plating.
